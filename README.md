# Problem Statement
In traditional customer support systems, all incoming cases are routed manually or using simple rules (such as based on keywords or customer type). This approach has several problems:
- **High-priority or negative cases may be delayed**, as they are not automatically identified.
- **Manual routing increases workload** for managers and support leads.
- **Customer dissatisfaction** grows when urgent cases are not resolved quickly. Organizations need a **smart, automated, and scalable solution** to:

    - Detect **customer sentiment** (Positive, Neutral, Negative) from case descriptions.
    - Assign urgent/negative cases to the **right team** immediately.
    - Provide **real-time visibility** into sentiment and priority trends for managers.
